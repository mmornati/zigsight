# Test Configuration Directory

This directory contains the Home Assistant configuration used for local integration testing.

## What's Here

- `configuration.yaml` - Main Home Assistant configuration
- `automations.yaml` - Automations (initially empty)
- `scripts.yaml` - Scripts (initially empty)
- `scenes.yaml` - Scenes (initially empty)
- `.storage/` - Auto-generated by Home Assistant (not in git)
- `*.db` - SQLite databases (not in git)

## Usage

This configuration is automatically used when you run:

```bash
./scripts/integration-test.sh start
```

or

```bash
make start
```

The integration testing environment:
1. Mounts this directory as `/config` in the Home Assistant Docker container
2. Mounts `custom_components/zigsight/` as the custom component
3. Starts Home Assistant on http://localhost:8123

## Customization

You can modify `configuration.yaml` to:
- Enable debug logging for the integration
- Add test automations
- Configure additional integrations for testing
- Adjust recorder settings

After making changes, restart Home Assistant:

```bash
./scripts/integration-test.sh restart
```

or

```bash
make restart
```

## Clean State

To start with a completely fresh Home Assistant installation:

```bash
./scripts/integration-test.sh clean
./scripts/integration-test.sh start
```

or

```bash
make clean
make start
```

This removes all stored data including the database and `.storage` directory.

## What's Not in Git

The following are automatically generated and excluded from git:
- `.storage/` - Home Assistant internal data
- `*.db*` - Database files
- `*.log*` - Log files
- `deps/` - Dependencies
- `tts/` - Text-to-speech cache

See `.gitignore` in this directory for the complete list.
