# Contributing to ZigSight

Thank you for your interest in contributing to ZigSight! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing to the project.

## 🎯 Ways to Contribute

- 🐛 Report bugs
- 💡 Suggest new features
- 📖 Improve documentation
- 🔧 Submit code changes
- ✅ Write tests
- 🎨 Improve UI/UX

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub
# Then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/zigsight.git
cd zigsight
```

### 2. Set Up Development Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

### 3. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

## 🧪 Development Workflow

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run tests quickly (no coverage)
make test-quick

# Run tests with coverage report
make test-coverage
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Run linting
make lint

# Format code
make format

# Check formatting (without changes)
make check-format

# Run all checks
make check
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks will run automatically on commit. To run manually:

```bash
# Run all hooks
make pre-commit

# Or directly
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## 📝 Code Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- Use [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for formatting and linting
- Use type hints throughout
- Document functions and classes with docstrings
- Follow Home Assistant integration patterns

### Type Hints

Always use type hints:

```python
from typing import Any
from homeassistant.core import HomeAssistant

def my_function(hass: HomeAssistant, value: str) -> bool:
    """Function description."""
    return True
```

### Async/Await

Use async/await for asynchronous operations:

```python
async def async_setup(hass: HomeAssistant) -> bool:
    """Async setup function."""
    await some_async_operation()
    return True
```

## 🧪 Writing Tests

### Test Requirements

- Write tests for all new functionality
- **Minimum 85% code coverage is enforced by CI** - PRs failing this check will be rejected
- Use pytest fixtures from `conftest.py`
- Follow the existing test structure

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
make test

# Run tests without coverage (faster)
make test-quick

# Run tests with HTML coverage report
make test-coverage

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_analytics.py -v

# Run tests matching a pattern
pytest -k "test_coordinator" -v
```

### Test Markers

Tests can be marked for categorization:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.slow
def test_long_running_operation():
    """Test that takes a long time."""
    pass

@pytest.mark.integration
def test_integration_with_mqtt():
    """Test that requires external services."""
    pass

@pytest.mark.unit
def test_pure_function():
    """Unit test for pure function."""
    pass
```

Run tests by marker:

```bash
# Skip slow tests
pytest -m "not slow"

# Run only unit tests
pytest -m unit

# Run only integration tests
pytest -m integration
```

### Coverage Reports

After running tests with coverage, you can view the report:

```bash
# Terminal report (shown automatically)
pytest tests/ --cov=custom_components/zigsight --cov-report=term

# HTML report (open htmlcov/index.html in browser)
pytest tests/ --cov=custom_components/zigsight --cov-report=html

# XML report (for CI tools like codecov)
pytest tests/ --cov=custom_components/zigsight --cov-report=xml
```

### Example Test

```python
"""Test module."""
import pytest
from unittest.mock import MagicMock

from custom_components.zigsight.coordinator import ZigSightCoordinator


@pytest.fixture
def mock_hass():
    """Create mock Home Assistant instance."""
    hass = MagicMock()
    hass.data = {}
    return hass


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_coordinator_construction(mock_hass):
    """Test coordinator can be constructed."""
    coordinator = ZigSightCoordinator(mock_hass)
    assert coordinator is not None
    assert coordinator.name == "zigsight"


@pytest.mark.unit
def test_analytics_compute():
    """Test analytics computation."""
    from custom_components.zigsight.analytics import DeviceAnalytics
    
    analytics = DeviceAnalytics()
    result = analytics.compute_reconnect_rate([])
    assert result == 0.0
```

### Async Tests

For testing async code, use `pytest-asyncio`:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_async_function():
    """Test async function."""
    result = await some_async_function()
    assert result is not None
```
